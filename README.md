Hangman

This project was created on Opiframe's Opikoodia programming course. We had studied Python for two weeks
and this project aims to showcase the skills I have learned at that point. I had done the same project earlier on
the C language so the process was quite familiar, but there were also considerable differences
due to inherent differences in the languages.

The game Hangman is essentially a word guessing game where the player is given the length of the word and
a number of guesses (in this program's case 6 wrong guesses) to try and guess letters that are in the word,
and eventually guess the whole word.

The biggest thing that was different about this project in Python compared to C, was the
existence of Python Membership Operators and the amount of effort that they saved compared to C,
while checking letters against words with if-statements. I feel that my understanding of functions
and the instinct where to use them improved from before.


Planned features:
We studied SQLite on the course and my next goal is to integrate an SQlite database into it.
I am planning to save a long list of words into the database which the program will then randomly
draw from when the main gameplay loop starts, instead of a list of words that is in the source code.
There will also be the option to add words into the database.
